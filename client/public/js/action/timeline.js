// TODO: take these notes, and create working timeline
// I also want to generate dividers for months, days, weeks, or years, based on timeline
    // implement a way to scan the timeline, and implement break points for different lengths of time
// sort the times in the array.
// position with the node wrapper
// I basically want to scale these nodes from their ordering on the timeline (date), to a value from 4 to 96.
// Scaling can happen by normalizing the values to less than one (divide by biggest element), then multiplying by 96-4 and adding 4
// to get the numbers from the timeline,
// from the css:
// left: 4%; right:4%;
